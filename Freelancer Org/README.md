This repository contains didactic artifacts related to the project developed in the Curricular Unit (UC) of Software Engineering (ESOFT) 2019-2020 edition of [Degree in Computer Engineering (LEI)](http://www.isep.ipp.pt/Course/Course/26) do [Higher Engineering Institute of Porto (ISEP)](http://www.isep.ipp.pt).

In particular, it contains:

* [Project description](docs/README.md)
* Proposed resolution for the activities of Requirements Engineering, Analysis and Design OO
* Source code made available to students as a starting point
* Description of the general functioning of the application provided


### General Application Operation

The following sequence diagram graphically represents the intended flow for the application where there is a clear separation (decoupling) between the domain classes and the user interaction classes (_user interface_). This decoupling is performed by classes with the suffix _Controller_.

In this UC it is intended that students concentrate essentially on the construction of domain classes (cf. documentation).
